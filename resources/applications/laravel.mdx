Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling.

Example repository [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify-examples/tree/main/laravel).

## Requirements

- Set `Build Pack` to `nixpacks`
- Set `APP_KEY`
- Set `Ports Exposes` to `80`

<Tip>
  If you configured your application before version beta.184 and set the
  `NIXPACKS_PHP_ROOT_DIR` and `NIXPACKS_PHP_FALLBACK_PATH` environment
  variables, you need to remove them.
</Tip>

### Other components

If your application needs a database or Redis, you can simply create them beforehand in the Coolify dashboard.

You will receive the connection strings which you can use in your application and set them as environment variables:

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=<DB_HOST>
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

REDIS_HOST=<REDIS_HOST>
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```
