Symfony is the leading PHP framework to create websites and web applications. Built on top of the Symfony Components. 

## Requirements

- Set `Build Pack` to `nixpacks`
- Set `APP_ENV`
- Set `APP_SECRET`
- Set `NIXPACKS_PHP_FALLBACK_PATH` to `/index.php`
- Set `NIXPACKS_PHP_ROOT_DIR` to `/app/public`
- Set `Ports Exposes` to `80`


### Other components

If your application needs a database or Redis, you can simply create them beforehand in the Coolify dashboard.

You will receive the connection strings which you can use in your application and set them as environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://app:!ChangeMe!@127.0.0.1:5432/app?serverVersion=16&charset=utf8

REDIS_HOST=<REDIS_HOST>
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```
