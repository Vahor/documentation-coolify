Ruby on Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backend web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Requirements

If you would like to migrate the database during the deployment with `NIXPACKS` build pack, you need to set the following `Start Command`:

```bash
bundle exec rake db:migrate && bundle exec bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p ${PORT:-3000} -e $RAILS_ENV
```
