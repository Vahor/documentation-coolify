## What is Redis

Redis is an in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a cache, vector database, document database, streaming engine, and message broker. Redis has built-in replication and different levels of on-disk persistence. It supports complex data types (for example, strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, and JSON), with atomic operations defined on those data types.
