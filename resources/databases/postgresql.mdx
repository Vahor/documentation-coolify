## What is PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It has more than 30 years of development and is widely used in the industry.

PostgreSQL, often simply "Postgres", uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
